A sample result file and Time Table have been provided for your testing

->This program was specifically designed to facilitate the students targeting different sections for different courses. You can get a custom timetable and check if your model has any clashes or not.

->Make sure your CSV file does not have an unnecessary space or character at the start of the line which has the day(i.e. Monday, Tuesday etc).
(Preferably use the one that comes with this project).

->Your CSV should be semicolon delimited since many courses have commas in between them.

->The input format is: 0,1,45,67

->If you find any bugs, please do give feedback since this is still a work in progress. More features will be added with time.
